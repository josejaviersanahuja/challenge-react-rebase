<h1> Engineering React Rebase Challenge </h1>

You will be expected to be able to contribute features and fixes without causing conflicts and other version control headaches. An important tool for keeping codebases clean is `git rebase`. This challenge will test your understanding of a basic codebase and your ability to use `git rebase` properly.

## The Challenge

There are two pull requests open on this repo. Each change is in its own branch. The challenge is to use `git rebase` to add both changes to `main`. When you are finished, your `main` branch should have three commits in the following order:

```
* feat: add Biology Today article
* feat: add Auto Review article
* fiat lux
```

_Any errors, missing features, missing tests, or failing tests will disqualify the solution._
